Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your  answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses  (the three dots) with your answers.
At the end, you will turn in this file along with your  modified
dna_analysis.py program.

Problem 1:
(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:
sample1
GC-content: 0.43029262963


Problem 3:
When you comment out
seq = " "
linenum = 0
you get the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "dna_analysis.py", line 40, in <module>
		linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

There is an error because the For loop contains an assignment statement to a  variable (linenum) that has not yet been declared.  If you were to comment out 
gc_count = 0
you would get an error for the same reason in a different For loop.  

Problem 4:
GC-content: 0.43029262963

Reflection: From this assignment I learned how to use a shell or command prompt  in both Windows and Mac to run a file (in addition to the coding itself, which is pretty  straightforward).  I knew what I needed to know before I started, and I probably  wouldn't do it differently.  Advice to future students would be "figure out how to use  the shell/command prompt so you can run the files for this assignment."
