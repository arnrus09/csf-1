Create a dictionary with five entries, where the keys are the names of states, and the values are those states' capitals.

Define a function that, given two numbers, returns 'positive' if the sum of those numbers is positive and 'negative if the sum is negative.

Using one or more of the following dictionaries, write two statements using the id function about object equality (one that prints True and one that prints False).
dict1 = {1:2, 3:4, 5:6}
dict2 = {1:2, 3:4, 5:6}
dict3 = dict1

Use a for loop to add 1 to each item on the following list and print each total.
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
