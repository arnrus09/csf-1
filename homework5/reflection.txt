Homework 5: Election prediction

Collaboration:
Had help from Cliff 

Reflection:
I learned how to use a For loop and a function to add items to a dictionary in a new function.  I would have liked to be able to complete the whole assignment but found it hard to find time to work on it.  I will probably complete the assignment on my own even though the quarter is over.
